## 🚀 Overview

Sentiment analysis helps understand the emotional tone behind text such as product reviews, tweets, comments, and feedback.

This app:
- Takes user input text  
- Processes it using NLP  
- Predicts sentiment instantly  
- Provides a clean and simple UI

## 🧠 How It Works

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Tokenization  
- Text cleaning (stopwords, punctuation, lowercase)  
- Lemmatization  
- Vectorization (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)

### **2. Model Building**
Models used (you can modify based on your project):
- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- SVM  
- LSTM (Optional – Deep Learning version)

Final model used: **Logistic Regression / SVM / LSTM

### **3. Prediction Pipeline**
- User enters text  
- Text is cleaned & vectorized  
- Model predicts sentiment  
- Output displayed in UI
